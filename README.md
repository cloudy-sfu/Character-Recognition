# Character Recognition

This program functions as the classifier of hand-written numbers & English characters.

## Dataset

`emnist-balanced.mat`: The training data.

## Usage

1. Run `load_data.m` to convert datasets in MATLAB format to Python format.
2. Run `main.py` to trains and valid the neural network model. 
3. Run `app.py` to read images and predict the characters on it.
